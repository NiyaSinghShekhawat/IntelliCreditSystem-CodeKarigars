## ✨ Features

### 🗂 Case Lifecycle Management
- **Supabase-backed** entity and case tables with full CRUD
- Case statuses: IN_PROGRESS → UNDER_REVIEW → CLOSED
- Officer closure form — collateral value, final interest rate, due diligence notes, closure remarks
- Re-open closed cases for further review
- All uploaded files, extraction results, analysis output, and reports stored per case

### 📄 Intelligent Data Ingestion (5 Document Types)
- **ALM** — Asset-Liability maturity bucket extraction
- **Shareholding Pattern** — promoter holding, pledge %, FII/DII
- **Borrowing Profile** — total borrowings, NCD, credit rating, lender count
- **Annual Report** — P&L, balance sheet, cashflow (PAT, net worth, D/E)
- **Portfolio / Performance Data** — AUM, GNPA, NIM, collection efficiency, CAR

Each extractor uses a two-tier pipeline:
1. Regex / keyword proximity search (fast, deterministic)
2. Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B fallback if < 3 fields extracted

### 🔬 Auto-Classification with HITL
- **PyMuPDF fast classifier** — scans all pages, scores by financial keyword density
- Per-doc-type keyword scoring — uses Annual Report keywords to score Annual Report pages, Portfolio keywords for Portfolio pages etc.
- LLM fallback via Groq for ambiguous documents
- **Human-in-the-loop confirmation** — confidence badge (HIGH/MED/LOW), editable selectbox, ✓ Confirm / Edit buttons
- **Dynamic schema editor** — `st.data_editor` with default schemas per doc type, fully editable
- 40k chars extracted per document (up from 12k in v1) — covers full financial tables

### 🔍 GST Reconciliation
- Separate GSTR-2A and GSTR-3B upload and extraction
- GSTR-2A ITC extracted by summing supplier ITC column (skips embedded reconciliation note rows)
- Variance analysis with configurable thresholds
- Circular trading detection via bank credit vs GST turnover ratio
- Hard policy rule: ITC variance ≥ 50% → minimum CONDITIONAL decision

### 📊 Risk Scoring Engine
- **XGBoost + SHAP** — explainable risk score 0.0–1.0
- **Extraction enrichment** — D/E ratio from Annual Report / Borrowing Profile auto-fills officer inputs; promoter pledge > 50% reduces promoter score
- Hard policy overrides — GST fraud signal floors score regardless of financials
- Decisive factor surfaced prominently below AI decision banner
- Loan limit calculated relative to requested amount

### 🤖 AI Reasoning Chain
- Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B — 4-step narrative (GST → Bank → Research → Inputs)
- ChromaDB RAG context from ingested documents
- Decisive factor and early warning signal extraction
- Graceful fallback when rate-limited

### 🧩 SWOT Analysis
- Generated from Five Cs scores + risk signals + research findings
- 2×2 grid rendered in UI and embedded in Investment Report
- Rule-based fallback when LLM unavailable
- Saved to Supabase `swot_json` column per case

### 🔎 Secondary Research & Macro Triangulation
- Google News RSS + GDELT with accent-normalised relevance filtering
- Per-entity risk queries: fraud, GST notice, defaulter, FIR, court case
- **Sector macro research** — RBI sectoral data, industry trends via Google News
- **Triangulation** — LLM synthesises news + legal + extracted financials into unified risk narrative with red flags, positives, recommended checks
- MCA charge check · e-Courts · RBI/SEBI regulatory actions

### 📋 Investment Assessment Report (PDF + DOCX)
- **5-page PDF** — white cover with entity + loan details, navy/gold branding
- Sections: Executive Summary · Financial Analysis · Five Cs · SHAP · Reasoning · SWOT · Research & Macro · Early Warnings · Conditions · Recommendation
- Semi-circular risk gauge · decision colour-coded banner · 4-column sign-off block
- DOCX version mirrors PDF structure
- Downloadable from both Results tab and Case View
- Branding: **IntelliCredit** (AI engine), not bank-specific

### 🖥 Officer Dashboard
- Default landing page — all cases with status badges, risk scores, loan amounts
- Filter by decision and sector
- One-click open → Case View with full audit trail
- Metrics row: Total / In Progress / Approved / Conditional / Rejected
